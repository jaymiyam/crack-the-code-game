# Crack The Code

### CS50x Final Project - A Number Guessing Game

#### Video Demo: https://youtu.be/9QJy6RiogfQ

This was a mini game that I loved to play on my electronic dictionary 20 years ago. Unfortunately I was unable to find the original game nor related information online, so I recreated it based on my own memory

### How To Play Crack The Code?

Crack The Code is a number guessing game!

- A 4-digit passcode is randomly generated by the computer, the goal is to crack the code.
- The code comprise of digits 1 to 9, excluding 0 and with no repeating digits.
- Input 4 digits each time and send for checking, an output sequence will be returned.
- Count of A: The number of digits in your guess that are both included in the passcode and in the correct position
- Count of B: The number of digits in your guess that are included in the passcode but not in the correct position.
- Example: For passcode '1234', input '4321' will return '0A4B', input '1357' will return '1A1B', and input '1235' will return 3A0B.
